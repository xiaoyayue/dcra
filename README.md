# DCRA
This folder encompasses the research results of a year-long project with the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. The aims of this project is to build machine learning models for insight finding in current housing inspection steps and thus identify the segments to be improved for a streamlined process. 

Due to confidentiality agreement, the repository only shows partial work which wouldn't result into a full replication of the project result and insight.

The <strong> cleaning&probe <strong> folder includes code for data access and cleaning tasks such as web-scrapping, API accessing,  data probing&harmonizations&merging, and data visualizations.

The <strong> modeling<strong> folder includes the randome tree and logit models used to predict house vacancies and flipping in DC. Before finalizing the models, our team also tried KNN, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayesian models. 

The <strong>NLP<strong> file contains a partial report of using text analysis approach to identify top violation categories for different types of property.
